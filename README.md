## Recommendation systems (Content-based and collaborative filtering)

### In the notebook there are 3 implementations for recommendation systems:
  1. Content-based using the pre-trained bert vectorizer to recommend similar books.
  2.  collaborative filter using item matrix and knn to recommend similar users (friends'suggest)
  3. collaborative filter using the `Surprise` library, just to calcualte the precision and the recall for the data (Surprise do everything by its own we don't have to do any thing but pass out the data)

**Note**: if you want to run first tow implementations you need to use [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
